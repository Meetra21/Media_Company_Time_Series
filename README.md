# Media Company Dataset â€“ Viewership Analysis  

This project analyzes the **Media Company Dataset** to investigate why viewership declined for a newly launched show. The analysis applies **Linear Regression** and **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)** to identify the most significant factors affecting audience engagement.  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal  

- Understand **factors influencing viewership** trends for the show.  
- Use **linear regression** to model relationships between features and viewership.  
- Apply **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)** to select the most relevant predictors.  
- Provide insights into possible reasons for **declining viewership** and data-driven recommendations.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset  

- **Source**: Media Company dataset.
- **Target Variable**: Viewership (number of viewers/engagement score).  
- **Features** (examples â€“ actual features depend on dataset):  
  - Day/Week/Month (temporal trends)  
  - Marketing Spend (advertisements, promotions)  
  - Content Rating (user reviews, likes/dislikes)  
  - Platform Reach (regional penetration, device usage)  
  - Show-related features (genre, duration, etc.)

## ðŸ§­ Workflow  

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Analyze viewership trends over time.  
- Compare performance across different features (marketing spend, ratings, etc.).  
- Identify periods of decline in audience engagement.  

### 2. Modeling  
- **Linear Regression**: Build a baseline regression model to explain variance in viewership.  
- **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)**: Iteratively select the most important predictors for viewership.  

### 3. Evaluation  
- Assess model performance with RÂ² and RMSE.  
- Compare baseline regression with feature-selected model.  
- Interpret coefficients to understand the influence of features.
